## Overview
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the cornerstone of the internetâ€™s address system. Still, its open nature makes it a frequent target for attacks such as DNS spoofing, DNS cache poisoning, amplification DDoS, and DNS tunneling. This list provides resources and tools to enhance DNS security, monitor DNS traffic, detect malicious usage, and deploy proper defenses.
